AI Content Assistant
This project is a web application that leverages the Google Gemini API to help users quickly summarize text content or web pages, extract key action items, and suggest next steps. It's designed to be a productivity tool for managing information overload, built with a focus on a clean user interface and robust AI integration.

Features
Content Summarization: Provides a concise, 3-5 sentence summary of any input text or web page.

Action Item Extraction: Identifies and lists actionable tasks or follow-ups clearly mentioned or implied in the content.

Suggested Next Steps: Offers relevant suggestions for further exploration or related information based on the analyzed content.

URL Processing: Automatically fetches and processes content from provided website URLs.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

Interactive Controls: "Process Content" button with loading indicator and a "Clear Content" button to reset inputs and outputs.

Custom Alert Modals: Provides clear, non-intrusive error and information messages to the user.

Secure API Handling: Uses a Node.js backend to securely proxy requests to the Gemini API, preventing direct exposure of your API key on the client-side.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid styling)

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

Lucide Icons (for modern UI icons)

Backend:

Node.js

Express.js (for building the REST API)

dotenv (for managing environment variables, specifically the API key)

axios (for making HTTP requests to fetch external web page content)

cheerio (for parsing HTML and extracting content from web pages)

@google/generative-ai (Google Gemini API Node.js SDK)

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Google Gemini API Key:

Go to Google AI Studio.

Sign in with your Google account.

Generate a new API key.

Keep this key secure! You will need it in the next step.

2. Project Setup
Create Project Directory:

mkdir ai-content-assistant
cd ai-content-assistant

Initialize Node.js Project:

npm init -y

Install Backend Dependencies:

npm install express cors dotenv axios cheerio @google/generative-ai

Create .env file:
In the root of your ai-content-assistant directory, create a file named .env and add your Gemini API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with the actual API key you obtained.

Create server.js:
In the root of your ai-content-assistant directory, create server.js and paste the provided backend code into it. (You have the latest version in our conversation history).

Create public Directory:

mkdir public

Create Frontend Files:
Inside the public directory, create the following files and paste the respective code:

public/index.html (You have the latest version in our conversation history).

public/style.css (You have the latest version in our conversation history).

public/script.js (You have the latest version in our conversation history).

How to Run the Application
Start the Backend Server:
Open your terminal, navigate to the ai-content-assistant root directory, and run:

node server.js

You should see a message indicating the server is listening on port 3000.

Open the Frontend in Your Browser:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000/index.html

You can now paste text or a URL into the input area and click "Process Content" to see the AI assistant in action!

Potential Future Enhancements
Local Storage/Session Management: Implement saving of processed content so users can revisit past summaries and action items.

User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and store their data securely in a database (e.g., Firestore).

Content Filtering/Categorization: Add options to filter action items by priority or category, or categorize summarized content.

Direct Integration with Task Managers: Buttons to export action items directly to popular task management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana, Google Tasks).

Advanced URL Handling: More sophisticated web scraping for dynamic content (e.g., using Puppeteer or Playwright).

Multi-modal Input: Extend to handle image inputs (e.g., summarize text from an image).

Streaming Responses: Display Gemini's output word-by-word as it's generated for a more dynamic user experience.

Customizable Prompts: Allow advanced users to tweak the prompts sent to Gemini for more control over the output.

Rate Limit Handling: Implement more graceful handling of Gemini API rate limits.
