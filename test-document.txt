The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. It has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The tower is 330 meters tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years. Regular maintenance of the tower includes applying 60 tons of paint every seven years to protect it from rust.
